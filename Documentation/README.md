# Documentation for Current Arduino Shields

This folder contains KiCad-generated schematics of the Arduino shields we use.

## Additional Notes

Some of the schematics include a CONN_01X02 connector near one or more larger
connectors. This connector represents the pin selector used on the majority
of the Arduino shields.
